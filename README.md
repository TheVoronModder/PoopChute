**PoopChute** is a purpose-built filament purge chute for MMU-equipped **Voron 2.4** printers. Designed to integrate cleanly with the Voron ecosystem, it directs purge material away from the build area during tool changes, helping keep the printer clean and multi-material prints consistent.

## Variants

There are **two versions** of PoopChute, depending on your **side skirt configuration**. Be sure to choose the version that matches your setup.

## Top Deck Panel

The top deck panel can be obtained in one of two ways:

- Order a pre-cut top deck from one of the listed **affiliates**
- Trace the provided top profile and cut your own panel from sheet material

Both options result in the same functional fit.
